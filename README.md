## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- vehicle weight, the angle of the mounted spoiler, and the presence of AWD on the vehicle all have direct non-zero impacts on the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, represented in miles per gallon.

- The slope of the regression model is non-zero due to the presence of influencing independant variables, such as the vehicle weight.

- The model should effectively predict future MechaCar model MPG results. The direction and magnitude of change in MPG given the independent variables makes sense, and the p-value of the test falls well within the confidence interval.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- The variance in PSI on each suspension coil falls within the 100PSI parameter set out when you consider all manufactured lots together, however, Lot 3 has a variance that falls outside that range by nearly double, at 170PSI.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- A t test of the data as a whole shows that the mean PSI falls right about at 1500PSI, where it is expected to be.

- The t test administered to individual lots shows that Lot 3 fell somewhat below the target mean of 1500PSI, for unknown reasons.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

- The next analysis we will conduct will examine the annual maintenance cost of MechaCar vehicles as compares to the competition.

- We aim to prove that our annual maintenance costs the same as or less than our competitors (null hypothesis)

- We would look at a slinear regression of the vehicles we currently have in production, so that the results can point toward categories that can be used to reduce future vehicle maintenance costs in newer product models.

- we will need annual maintenance costs for a selection of vehicles, defined by model and options package. This will allow us to pinpoint what, if any, options are less reliable than others.
